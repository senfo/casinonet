### Project Description
Casino.NET is a simple casino game built on the Microsoft XNA framework 3.0, which is being built as a learning experience. Anybody that is interested in joining the project, please feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear from developers and artists, alike.

### Current Project State
Casino.NET is still very much at the beginning stages of development. While the source compiles, there is little more than a couple of test applications that were thrown together in order to verify some logic. Unit tests are actively being developed in an effort to follow a TDD approach. Currently focusing on game interface and a poker game. Additional games to be added in due time.
